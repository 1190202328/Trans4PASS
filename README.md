**Bending Reality: Distortion-aware Transformers for Adapting to Panoramic Semantic Segmentation**

![trans4pass](fig_trans4pass.png)



### Introduction

To get around this domain difference and bring together semantic annotations from pinhole- and 360â—¦ surround-visuals, we propose to learn object deformations and panoramic image distortions in the Deformable Patch Embedding (DPE) and Deformable MLP (DMLP) components which blend into our Transformer for PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (Trans4PASS) model.

More detailed can be found in our [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01452.pdf) paper.

### Usage

The code and model weights will be release soon.
